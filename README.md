# Smart Health Devices and Privacy Impact Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, part of the COMP 555 Information Privacy course, aims to explore the evolving landscape of privacy concerns in the context of smart health devices, with a focus on wearable smartwatches like Fitbit. Our investigation covers the transition from simple, non-connected fitness trackers to sophisticated devices that collect, store, and potentially share a wide array of personal health data.
