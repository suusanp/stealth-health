# Smart Health Devices and Privacy Impact Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, part of the COMP 555 Information Privacy course, aims to explore the evolving landscape of privacy concerns in the context of smart health devices, with a focus on wearable smartwatches like Fitbit. Our investigation covers the transition from simple, non-connected fitness trackers to sophisticated devices that collect, store, and potentially share a wide array of personal health data.

## Getting Started with the Project

This repository is structured to facilitate collaborative research, documentation, and analysis of privacy implications related to smart health devices. Here's how you can contribute and utilize the resources available in this repository.

## Repository Structure

- **`/m1`**: Contains all files related to Milestone 1, including research documentation, analysis, and the initial report draft.
- **`/docs`**: Documentation, including project proposals, meeting notes, and feedback from TA sessions.
- **`/data`**: Original data sets, including survey responses, API data pulls, and anonymized user data for analysis.
- **`/scripts`**: Code used for data analysis, including Python notebooks and scripts for processing and visualizing data.

## How to Contribute

1. **Clone the Repository**: Get a local copy of the repository for development and testing purposes.
    ```
    git clone https://gitlab.cs.mcgill.ca/gaby.lebideau/c555w24-t10.git
    cd c555w24-t10
    ```

2. **Issue Tracking**: Utilize GitLab Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Summarize discussions and decisions made during project meetings here.

3. **Merge Requests**: For adding new features or fixing bugs, create a new branch and submit merge requests for review by team members.

4. **Data Privacy**: Ensure all data used or generated adheres to ethical guidelines and privacy laws. Anonymize sensitive data before sharing or analysis.

## Project Milestones

- **Milestone 1**: Privacy Impact of Transition from Non-Connected to Connected Smart Health Devices.
- **Milestone 2**: Analysis of User Awareness and Consent Mechanisms.
- **Milestone 3**: Security Vulnerabilities and Data Breach Incidents Analysis.
- **Final Report**: Compilation of research findings, analyses, and recommendations for enhancing privacy protections in smart health devices.

## Tools and Resources

- **GitLab CI/CD**: For continuous integration and deployment. Automated testing and code quality checks will be set up using GitLab's CI/CD pipelines.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: To analyze the code for known vulnerabilities.
- **Survey Tools**: For conducting user awareness and perception surveys regarding smart health device privacy.
