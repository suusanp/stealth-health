## Implementation Details

### Rationale for Selecting React Native

We chose React Native for our Fitbit app prototype due to its cross-platform capabilities, to develop a single codebase that can be deployed on both iOS and Android devices. Our group members use both Android and Apple devices, and we wanted to ensure that the app would be accessible to all team members during the development process. Additionally, React Native has extensive documentation and a large community, which we can use for troubleshooting and support since none of our team members had prior experience with mobile app development. Our team has also had previous experience developing in React, which made the transition to React Native smoother.

### Expo as a Development Platform

Expo is a comprehensive framework for developing React Native applications across iOS, Android, and web platforms. It simplifies the development process by abstracting complex platform-specific details, enabling our team to focus on creating a seamless user experience.

### Rationale for Selecting Expo

Expo is renowned for facilitating the development of cross-platform applications with React Native, putting efficiency and developer experience at the forefront. It is open-source and has a large community of developers, so as beginners to mobile app development, we can easily get started with Expo. We also chose Expo because it is test-friendly; We each downloaded the Expo Go app, which allows us to preview the app on real devices during development. 

#### Evaluation of Expo's Privacy Policies and Open-Source Nature

Expo's commitment to privacy is evident through its GDPR, CCPA, and Privacy Shield compliance, ensuring the responsible handling of both developer and end-user data. This commitment is articulated in their Privacy Policy, updated on June 22nd, 2022, and further explained in their privacy exposition dated February 7th, 2020.

- **Data Collection and Use**: "When you create an account on Expo or use our tools and services, we collect data including your name, email, and, if you enable paid services, your billing information... This data helps us make decisions about our products and services, in addition to allowing us to deliver satisfactory user experiences." (Expo, Privacy Policy)

- **Data Processor and Controller Roles**: "When a developer uses Expo's services to create an app and distributes it to their users (end-users), we become a data processor because we process end-user data on behalf of the developer." (Expo, Privacy Explained)

- **End-User Data Minimalism**: "When end-users use apps built by Expo, we collect very little end-user data. The data we may collect includes the end-user's push token... These requests do not contain identifying information such as unique device identifiers." (Expo, Privacy Explained)

- **Security and Compliance**: The explicit statement that Expo is "GDPR-, CCPA-, and Privacy Shield-compliant" in all scenarios underscores a robust framework for privacy and data protection.

#### Open-Source Contribution
Expo's open-source ecosystem is important, offering transparency and community engagement that aligns with our project's philosophy. 


### Database Structure and Data Security

#### What type of data we collect and how it is organized.


#### Choosing the Right Storage Solution

When selecting a storage solution for our application, we evaluated various options, including SQLite and server-based solutions. While SQLite is a widely used database for storage in mobile applications, it typically does not store data directly on the device. A local storage approach aligns with our goal to avoid storing sensitive user data on servers due to the inherent risks of server-side data breaches and unauthorized access.

Furthermore we were concerned By  SQLite was its limited support for built-in encryption. Ensuring the privacy and security of user data is paramount in our application; thus, we sought a solution that offered robust encryption capabilities out of the box. The need for encryption is not just about protecting data if the device is lost or compromised; it's about ensuring that data remains private and secure from any unauthorized access, intentional or accidental.

#### SecureStore for Sensitive Permanent and Semi-Permanent Information

Given these considerations, we decided to utilize Expo's SecureStore for storing sensitive personal information. SecureStore offers an encrypted key-value store, which provides several advantages:

- **Encryption by Default**: SecureStore automatically encrypts data before it is saved, providing encryption at rest without the need for additional encryption layers. This feature is crucial for protecting sensitive information like age range, gender, height, and weight.

- **Ease of Use**: With SecureStore, we benefit from an intuitive API for storing and retrieving encrypted data. 

- **Platform Security Features**: SecureStore leverages the uses the security features of the device's platform, offering a level of security that is consistent with the device's overall security.


Significant features of SecureStore include:

- **Data Isolation**: It ensures data is stored within the app's sandbox, preventing access by other apps and safeguarding against unauthorized data breaches.

- **Dynamic Management**: The following segments of our code demonstrate how we securely handle user data, such as age range, gender, height, weight, and fitness goals.

    ```javascript
    export const getPersonalInfo = async () => {
  // Define the keys for the personal information we want to retrieve
  const keys = ['ageRange', 'gender', 'height', 'weight', 'fitnessGoals'];
  const info = {};
  
  // Iterate over the keys, retrieving each piece of information from SecureStore
  // and adding it to the info object. This demonstrates how SecureStore can be used
  // to securely retrieve encrypted data.
  for (const key of keys) {
    const value = await SecureStore.getItemAsync(key);
    info[key] = value;
  }
  return info;```
 
 To update their data, users go through functions that retrieve their current data ( using getPersonalInfo), allow them to make changes, and then save these updates back to the device securely ( usingsavePersonalInfo) new information will overwrite the previous one, no history of the old data is kept within our software. If a user chooses to delete their data, our application uses SecureStore's deleteItemAsync for each data point, ensuring all personal information is removed from the device. This maintains data security and gives users complete control over their information.

#### Encryption and Decryption Methodologies

Our encryption strategy incorporates the following practices:

1. **Dynamic Encryption Key Generation**: Utilizing the SHA-256 hashing algorithm through Expo's Crypto module, we generate a unique encryption key for each user session.
2. **Secure Encryption Key Storage**: The encryption key is securely stored using SecureStore, ensuring that the key itself benefits from SecureStore's encryption.
3. **Efficient Data Encryption and Decryption**: We serialize user data into a string, encrypt it using the dynamic key, and decrypt it upon retrieval, ensuring end-to-end security of sensitive information.

#### Commitment to Data Minimization

In line with privacy-by-design principles, we collect data in age ranges rather than specific ages, minimizing the risk of personal identification. This approach underscores our commitment to collecting only the data necessary for providing our services, thereby enhancing user privacy.

Our choice of SecureStore, coupled with our strategic approach to data collection and encryption, ensures that our application not only meets but exceeds the privacy and security expectations of our users.
