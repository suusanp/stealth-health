# TA Meeting Notes and Transition Ideas for Smart Health Devices Project

## Transition Ideas

- **Gym Equipment Evolution**: From equipment tracking heart rate/calories on a single-use basis to user-based sign-in systems with options to connect to phones/smartwatches.
- **Pedometer Evolution**: Transition from low-tech/offline pedometers and heart rate trackers to wearable devices that connect and track multiple data points simultaneously.
- **Identification Methods**: Shift from equipment without sign-in/identification methods to smartwatches tracking extensive user information (age, sex, weight, location, etc.).

## TA Meeting Feedback

- **Baseline Concerns**: Focus on the baseline privacy concerns at the earliest stage (pre-smartwatches) and analyze how the transition to new smartwatch technologies increases privacy concerns. Link specific causes to these concerns.
- **Fitbit Evolution**: Study the first iteration of Fitbit (classic 2007) without app connectivity and document the version-to-version changes in privacy concerns.
- **Instrumentation and Monitoring**: Initially proposed to wear an Apple Watch to monitor data collection throughout a day. This will be adapted to using Fitbit devices.
- **GitLab Usage**: Emphasize the use of GitLab and GitLab Issues to document and summarize discussions.

## Notable Incidents and Concerns

- **Strava 2018 Incident**: [Fitness tracking app exposes locations of secret US army bases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/28/fitness-tracking-app-gives-away-location-of-secret-us-army-bases). Also, concerns about de-anonymization to find individuals' home addresses.
- **Bluetooth Vulnerabilities**: [Communication vulnerabilities between smartwatches and phones](https://www.securityweek.com/communications-between-smartwatches-and-phones-exposed-hack-attacks-researchers).
- **Insurance Data Sharing**: [Insurance companies offering discounts in exchange for Fitbit data](https://www.govtech.com/health/could-your-fitbit-data-be-used-to-deny-you-health-insurance.html).
- **Consumer Awareness**: Issues with consumer unawareness of data collection policies and the public sharing default privacy settings.
- **Data Anonymization Concerns**: Challenges with "anonymized" data being potentially de-anonymized.
- **Data Breach Incident**: [Over 61 million fitness tracker users' data exposed](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/digital-health/fitbit-apple-user-data-exposed-breach-impacting-61m-fitness-tracker-records).
- **HIPAA Coverage**: Clarification that HIPAA does not necessarily cover data collected by fitness trackers.
- **Fitbit Web APIs**: Public APIs allow developers access to the data collected by Fitbit devices.
- **Company Acquisitions**: Privacy policy changes and concerns following acquisitions, e.g., Google's purchase of Fitbit.

## Specific Project Ideas

- **Security of Device Connections**: Investigate the security of connections between smart health devices and phones.
- **Data Anonymization**: Focus on ensuring data cannot be de-anonymized and traced back to individuals.
- **User Awareness**: Enhance user awareness regarding data collection, sharing, and privacy settings.
- **Non-Location-Tracking**: Explore the possibility of tracking health activities without location tracking.
- **IoT/Cloud Architecture**: Demonstrate safer connection architectures between smartwatches, phones, and other devices.
- **Market Analysis**: Analyze different smartwatches available in the market with a focus on privacy features.

## GDPR and International Data Transfers

- **Fitbit GDPR Data Transfer Complaints**: [Concerns over forced consent for international data transfers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/30/fitbit-gdpr-data-transfer-complaints-noyb/), with users unable to withdraw consent without losing access to services and data.
- **Data Categories**: Includes email, DOB, gender, health data, and more.
- **Third-Party Processing**: Analysis of Fitbit's privacy policy related to analytics and advertising services provided by third parties.

This markdown organizes the initial ideas, TA feedback, notable incidents, and specific project ideas for the Smart Health Devices and Privacy Impact Analysis project. It serves as a foundational document for further research and analysis.
