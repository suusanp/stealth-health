# March 13 TA Meeting 2

- **Simulator Functionality and Data**: Create a Fitbit API simulator focused on a specific aspect, such as the pedometer function, using fake data that mimics real user data.
- **API Structure and Alignment**: Ensure the simulator closely resembles the real Fitbit API, with aligned API calls:
  - Develop an identical simulator API structure to Fitbit's.
  - Adjust API responses if needed for improved privacy without affecting functionality.
  - Basically the idea is to make a simulator that can replace part of Fitbit code while maintaining full functionality.
- **Privacy Enhancements**: Prioritize user privacy by making minimal changes to the API (e.g., reducing data collection, localizing functionalities)
  - Must justify and document these privacy-enhancing modifications.
- **Front-End Consideration**: The simulator does not need a front-end, though we will aim to make one.
