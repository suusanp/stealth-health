# Summary of Team Meetings

## Feb 8, 2024

- Went over TA feedback
- Narrowed down scope of the project to two possible topics: the evolution of heart sensors or the evolution of FitBit devices (from tracking device to smart watch)
- Discussed examples of devices tracking our activity
- Discussed research methods and how we can experiment with FitBit devices (downloading app, emulators)
- Next steps: prepare presentation slides, continue research
- Next meeting: Feb 9 and/or Feb 10 


## Feb 10, 2024

- Organized flow/structure of presentation
- More research about the issue
- Divided work and organized who will talk about what
- Narrowed down topic 
- Next steps: prepare slides, practice presentation
- Next meeting: Feb 11 and/or Feb 12

## Feb 23, 2024

- Discussed and narrowed ideas for Milestone 3
- Researched Fitbit API and possible ways to mitigate privacy concerns (possibly a privacy-focused offline app)
- Ruled out the idea of using Fitbit API, since it requires giving Google access to all data before it can be accessed by third-party developers
- Brainstormed possible alternative to Fitbit:
    - Wearable pedometre with no internet connection, input data manually into a local app
    - Fitness app is entirely local and does not require internet connection
    - App relies on user input to track fitness and health data, with a focus on meaningful/informed consent 
    - Anonymized data collection
- Next steps: draft a rough outline of Milestone 3 and consult with a TA or Professor Robillard
- Next meeting: Feb 26

## Feb 29, 2024

- Discussed and created a draft of the Architecture 
- Discussed the platform and user interface of the App, decided on creating an Android app
- App functions summary:
    - ask consent for user to send regular notifications to remind to import their data, as well as to track their sleep cycle
    - options to import data from as many wearable devices as they want: pedometer, heart rate monitor etc.
    - options to input their age, weight, gender etc.
    - reminders and options to regularly input health data such as resting heart rate, blood pressure when they get them checked
    - ask user consent to access their location to track the distance they walk/run, to track their exercise data
    - calculates calories burned etc. by fully online algorithms
    - a visible and easy to access button the user can click on to learn about the App's privacy policy, as well as a dedicated section explaining the privacy implications of every choice the user makes in the app.
- Created an issue to divide the To-Do for next steps, next steps will be to add the discussed details to the Architecture document as well as create the high level design diagrams.
