# Summary of Team Meetings

## Feb 8, 2024

- Went over TA feedback
- Narrowed down scope of the project to two possible topics: the evolution of heart sensors or the evolution of FitBit devices (from tracking device to smart watch)
- Discussed examples of devices tracking our activity
- Discussed research methods and how we can experiment with FitBit devices (downloading app, emulators)
- Next steps: prepare presentation slides, continue research
- Next meeting: Feb 9 and/or Feb 10 


## Feb 10, 2024

## Feb 23, 2024

- Discussed and narrowed ideas for Milestone 3
- Researched Fitbit API and possible ways to mitigate privacy concerns (possibly a privacy-focused offline app)
- Ruled out the idea of using Fitbit API, since it requires giving Google access to all data before it can be accessed by third-party developers
- Brainstormed possible alternative to Fitbit:
    - Wearable pedometre with no internet connection, input data manually into a local app
    - Fitness app is entirely local and does not require internet connection
    - App relies on user input to track fitness and health data, with a focus on meaningful/informed consent 
    - Anonymized data collection
- Next steps: draft a rough outline of Milestone 3 and consult with a TA or Professor Robillard
- Next meeting: Feb 26
