# A very rough idea/draft of Milestone 3

## Architecture Design for Alternative Fitness App 

### Introduction

Due to privacy concerns with the Fitbit API, we have decided to create an alternative application which tracks fitness and health data while prioritizing user privacy.

The architecture design of our application is based on the principles of privacy by design. We aim to create an application that is entirely local and does not require an internet connection. This means that the application will not collect any data from the user, and the user will have to input their fitness and health data manually. Users will pair the application with a wearable pedometer that does not require an internet connection, and enter their fitness and health data manually into the application. 

The application will provide the user with tools to analyze their fitness and health data, and will not share any data with third parties. No advertisements will be displayed in the application.

### Functional Components

- User Interface: The user interface will be designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing the user to input their fitness and health data easily.

- Data Storage: The application will store the user's fitness and health data locally on their device. This data will not be shared with any third parties.

- Data Analysis: The application will provide the user with tools to analyze their fitness and health data. This will allow the user to gain insights into their health and fitness, without having to share their data with any third parties.

- Consent Management: The application will provide the user with clear and transparent information about what data is being collected and how it is being used. The user will have the ability to provide or withdraw consent for the collection and use of their data at any time.

### Privacy Considerations

The architecture of our application is designed to prioritize user privacy. By keeping all data local and not requiring an internet connection, we ensure that the user has full control over their data. The user will be able to decide what information they want to share with the application, and their data will not be collected or shared with any third parties.

### Privacy Requirements

- The application will follow PIPEA guidelines, as well as the principles of privacy by design.

- The application must not collect any data from the user without their explicit consent.

- The application must clearly and transparently inform the user about what data is being collected and how it is being used.

- The user must have the ability to provide or withdraw consent for the collection and use of their data at any time.

- The application must store the user's fitness and health data locally on their device, and this data must not be shared with any third parties.

- The user interface must be designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing the user to input their fitness and health data easily.

- The application will not share any data with third parties, and will not display any advertisements.
